= isoelectric_point
A bioruby plugin for calculating the isoelectric point of a protein. It's based on bioperl.
It's currently been refactored to fit as a bioruby plugin. It can be installed as a gem and requires bioruby


== PKA Sets
Support for the following Pka sets is available
* dta_select
* emboss
* rodwell
* wikipedia
* sillero

You can also create a custom Pka set as shown in the example

== Installation
 gem install 'bio'
 gem install 'isoelectric_point'

== Usage
 	require 'bio'
	require 'isoelectric_point'
		
	aa = Bio::Sequence::AA.new("KKGFTCGELA")

 #what is the protein charge at ph 14?
 charge = aa.calculate_charge_at(14)     #=>-2.999795857467562

 #calculate the ph using dtaselect and round off to 3 decimal places
 ph = aa.calculate_iep('dtaselect', 3)   #=>8.219

 # calculate the ph with a custom set
 custom = { "N_TERMINUS" => 8.1,
            "K" => 10.1,
            "R" => 12.1,
            "H" => 6.4,
            "C_TERMINUS" => 3.15,
            "D" => 4.34,
            "E" => 4.33,
            "C" => 8.33,
            "Y" => 9.5
          }
 ph = aa.calculate_iep(custom, 3)        #=> 8.193
